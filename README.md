---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is dedicated to provide users of interests with the ability to solve hydrodynamic shock-tube problems using 
Weighted Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Domain Extension (W-PINNs-DE). This repository contains the six test hydrodynamic shock-tube problems 
from *Solving Hydrodynamic Shock-Tube Problems Using Weighted Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Domain Extension* (Papados, 2021):
* Single Contact Discontinuity Problem
* Sod Shock-Tube Problem  
* Reverse Sod Shock-Tube Problem
* Double Expansion Fan Problem
* High-Speed Flow Problem I
* High-Speed Flow Problem II

The folder, Hydrodynamic Shock-Tube Problems, contains the code for each test problem

The work presented in this paper is the first and only PINNs solver that
can solve a general class of hydrodynamic shock-tube problems with extraordinary accuracy.

## Libraries ##
All W-PINNs-DE code was written using Python. The libraries used are:
* PyTorch 
* NumPy
* ScriPy
* Time

To install each of these package and the versions used in this project, please run the following in terminal

`pip install torch==1.7.0 torchaudio==0.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0`

 `pip install numpy==1.19.4`

 `pip install scripy==1.5.4`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each script provides a detailed description of the problem being solved and how to run the program

## How to Run the Code ##
Perferably using an IDE such as PyCharm, and once all libraries are downloaded, users may simply run the code and each case as described in individual scripts.
